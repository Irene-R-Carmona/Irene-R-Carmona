# Hi there! 👋 I'm Irene Reyes Carmona

👀 I’m interested in web development, especially in creating interactive and responsive user interfaces. I also enjoy exploring new technologies and finding innovative solutions to coding challenges.

🌱 I’m currently learning both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I'm diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build engaging user experiences. On the backend, I'm exploring server-side development with Node.js and databases. Additionally, I'm enhancing my Java skills to develop applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that can make a positive impact on the community. If you have an exciting project in web development, I'd love to hear about it!

📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me via email at reyescarmona.irene@gmail.com.

⚡ Fun fact: I have visited 20 countries and love exploring new cultures
